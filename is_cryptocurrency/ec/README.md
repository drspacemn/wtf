## WTF is an Elliptic Curve?

- Elliptic Curve: plane algebraic curve defined by an equation of the form
- curve where all the points(x,y coords) satisfy an equation

- perform them inside a finite field over a prime number
- every operation within the basic arithmetic works modulo a prime
- when adding two integers i and j of bitlength b, result will be bitlength b + 1
- y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
- make a list of a lot of y coordinatesapply the equation you should obtain a cruve 
- negative and positive y axis will be the same
- if a line intersects two points in the curve it will always intersect a third
- factoring is slow and multiplication is fast
- public key and private key
- choose a maximum number and deal with numbers less than that max
- max value is obtained by multiplying two random prime numbers
- 
- 13 7 max number 91
- pub key is 5
- private key is 29
