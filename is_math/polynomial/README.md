## WTF is a Polynomial?
Polynomial meaning "many terms". This polynomial has 3 terms:
```
4xy^2 + 3x - 5
|-1-|  |2|  |3|
```

Polynomials can have constants(e.g. 4, 3), variables(e.g. x, y), and exponents(e.g. ^2) and can be combined using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
BUT not division by a variable. Polynomicals can have constants, variables, and exponents, but never division by a variable

With the strict definition, polynomials are easy to work with. For instance:
- a polynomial + a polynomial = a polynomial
- a polynomial X a polynomial = a polynomial
  
Polynomials with one variable are easy to graph and have continuous lines. 

The degree of a polynomial with one variable is the largest exponent of that variable.
