## WTF is Just-in-time Compilation?

### Notes:
- way of executing computer code that involves compilation during execution of a program(at runtime) rather than before execution
- Typically bytecode translation to machine code
- Continuously analyzes the code being executed and identifies parts of the code where the speedup gained from compilation or
- A middle ground between ahead-of-time compilation and interpretation
